Approximately 61.5% of original orangutan habitats will be destroyed by 2025.

Why are they important?
Often described as “gardeners of the forest”, orangutans play a crucial role in maintaining the environments within forests. They are inadvertently responsible for aiding seed dispersal within the forests due to their fruit and plant-based diets. In fact, many seeds would not germinate successfully without the digestion of orangutans (seaworld lol). Therefore, the loss of orangutans would further propel the environmental degradation and biodiversity loss within the rainforest of Indonesia as species of plants will perish. 

Current situation:
Native to the tropical rainforests of Indonesia, Orangutans have been classified as critically endangered with habitat loss being the leading cause. Though there are conservation and protected areas, illegal plantations have forced more than 50% of the orangutan population into unprotected forest where they become vulnerable to poachers. Aside from dealing with habitat loss, low reproductive rates amongst Orangutans make their populations highly vulnerable. As females only give birth to one infant at a time every seven to nine years, each female will only be able to bear four to five babies over a lifetime. Therefore, making it harder for the species to recover from population declines. 

Introducing Palm Oil:
To understand the main driver of habitat loss, we have to look at the palm oil industry.  Despite the environmental devastation palm oil production in southeast asia has garnered extensive media coverage in the past, it has yet to deter the rapid growth of the industry, consequently it has not decreased deforestation for the purpose of palm oil production. 

So why has the palm oil industry thrived in the past decade?
Surprisingly, half of the world's population rely on palm oil as a part of their diet. Thus, as the global population grows, so will the demand for palm oil. Furthermore, many companies globally are not legally required to label palm oil as an ingredient. Instead, it is often labelled under other terms such as ‘vegetable oil’ or ‘vegetable fat’, causing a lot of consumers to be unaware of how frequently they are purchasing products with palm oil. (maybe put photo of like stuff with palm oil that's surprising)

To put the growth of palm oil production into perspective, in 1970, the world produced 2 million tonnes of palm oil. By 2020, half a century later, 75.88 million tonnes of palm oil was produced. This represents an increase of 36.9 times the amount recorded in 1970. 

Indonesia:
Oil palm is a tropical plant species often found in countries around the equator as it thrives on high rainfall, humid conditions and sunlight. Thus, it can be found in many countries across Africa, South AMerica and Southeast Asia. However, the global production of palm oil is dominated by Indonesia which produced 58.99% of the world’s palm oil in 2020. 
To meet increasing global demand, deforestation is needed to pave the way for palm oil production facilities. The severity of changes in forest area globally are shown, as you can see, deforestation in Indonesia is higher than other countries with a loss of 400,000 hectares per year. Furthermore, a study done by the IUCN showed that at least 50% of all deforestation between 2005 and 2015 on Borneo, an island that belongs primarily to Indonesia and Malaysia, was related to palm oil development. Despite a moratorium in 2011 prohibiting the conversion of primary natural forests and peatlands for commodity farming, rates of deforestation in Indonesia have fluctuated greatly, with loopholes in the law allowing for deforestation of secondary forests, which serve as habitats for many endemic animals.
Thus, the production of palm oil is directly causing an impact on habitat loss within the rainforests of indonesia. Consequently, pushing orangutans closer to extinction. 

All these unsustainable production practices reiterate the need for government intervention and regulation to protect the habitat loss. Though the Indonesian government is central in the protection of orangutans due to deforestation, the global community also has a responsibility to discourage unsustainable practices, and place pressures on companies and governments to act.  As Indonesia is one of the world’s largest exporters of deforestation, it is clear that the global demand for its product is one of the main causes for deforestation. As such, reiterating the role global consumers contribute to the destruction of the homes of vulnerable orangutans. 

Although the deforestation caused by palm oil has resulted in detrimental habitat losses, it is important we do not disregard the benefits of palm oil production or call for boycotts of the product. Instead it would be more beneficial to cultivate and encourage sustainable practices as this could actually improve the environment. Of all the vegetable oils available, palm oil is considerably the most efficient in terms of yield to land use ratio. Therefore, if we discourage the use of palm oil and consumers have to switch to other forms of vegetable oils, we risk increasing the rate of deforestation. Consequently speeding up the demise of the orangutans. 

WIth the chances of decreasing the orangutan population decreasing by 25% over the next three years, and a projected decrease of more than 80% in the next decade, it is imperative we take action now. Organisations such as RSPO are crucial in the transformation of the palm oil industry towards a more sustainable future. We should be actively supporting these efforts and as global citizens, be more conscious of the origins of our purchases. Furthermore, there are several foundations that are active in conservation efforts of orangutans in indonesia. For example, the orangutan foundation which is also active in replenishing forest areas to ensure the welfare of the orangutan’s habitat. 

To reiterate, as consumers the best thing we can do is purchase foods and products with sustainably produced palm oil. It is important to remember that boycotting is not the answer, demanding more action in conservation efforts and sustainable practices are. If we do not take action now, experts estimate that orangutans could possibly go extinct within a decade. Are we really willing to standby and let this species die out due to our greed and disregard for the natural world?






Fun facts:
Orangutans and humans share 97% of their DNA.

Orangutans learn everything from their mum! Infants are so attached to their mums that they ride on her body and sleep in her nest until they develop their own skills to survive on their own.
