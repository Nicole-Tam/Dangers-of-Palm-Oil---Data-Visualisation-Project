                <h2>Why are they important?</h2>
                <p>
                    Often described as “gardeners of the forest”, orangutans play a crucial role in maintaining the
                    environments within forests. They are inadvertently responsible for aiding seed dispersal within the
                    forests due to their fruit and plant-based diets. In fact, many seeds would not germinate
                    successfully without the digestion of orangutans. Therefore, the loss of orangutans
                    would further propel the environmental degradation and biodiversity loss within the rainforest of
                    Indonesia as species of plants will perish.

            <h2>Current situation:</h2>
            <p>
                Native to the tropical rainforests of Indonesia, orangutans have been classified as critically
                endangered
                with habitat loss being the leading cause. Though there are conservation and protected areas, illegal
                plantations have forced more than 50% of the orangutan population into unprotected forest where they
                become vulnerable to poachers.

                <br><br>
                Aside from dealing with habitat loss, low reproductive rates amongst
                orangutans make their populations highly vulnerable. As females only give birth to one infant at a time
                every seven to nine years, each female will only be able to bear four to five babies over a lifetime.
                Therefore, making it harder for the species to recover from population declines.

        <h2> To understand the main driver of habitat loss, we have to look at the palm oil industry. Despite the
            environmental devastation palm oil production in southeast asia has garnered extensive media coverage in the
            past, it has yet to deter the rapid growth of the industry, consequently it has not decreased deforestation
            for the purpose of palm oil production.</h2>

            <h2>So why has the palm oil industry thrived in the past decade?</h2>
            <p>
                Surprisingly, half of the world's population rely on palm oil as a part of their diet. Thus, as the
                global
                population grows, so will the demand for palm oil. Furthermore, many companies globally are not legally
                required to label palm oil as an ingredient. Instead, it is often labelled under other terms such as
                ‘vegetable oil’ or ‘vegetable fat’, causing a lot of consumers to be unaware of how frequently they are
                purchasing products with palm oil. '

                Furthermore, palm oil is found in many different products, including, <a

                To put the growth of palm oil production into perspective, in 1970, the world produced 2 million tonnes
                of
                palm oil. By
                2020, half a century later, 75.88 million tonnes of palm oil was produced.<br><br>This represents an
                increase of
                36.9 times the
                amount recorded in 1970.

            <p id="chloroText">The
                severity of changes in forest area globally are shown below.

                <br><br>As you can see, deforestation in Indonesia
                is higher than
                other countries with a <strong>loss of 400,000 hectares per year.</strong> Furthermore, a study done by
                the IUCN showed
                that at least 50%
                of all deforestation between 2005 and 2015 on Borneo, an island that belongs primarily to Indonesia and
                Malaysia, was
                related to palm oil development. <br><br>Despite a moratorium in 2011 prohibiting the conversion of
                primary
                natural forests and
                peatlands for commodity farming, rates of deforestation in Indonesia have fluctuated greatly, with
                loopholes in the law
                allowing for deforestation of secondary forests, which serve as habitats for many endemic animals.
                <br><br>Thus, the production of palm oil is directly causing an impact on habitat loss within the
                rainforests of
                Indonesia, consequently pushing orangutans closer to extinction.

                Though the Indonesian government is central in the
                protection of
                their orangutans, the global community also has a responsibility to discourage unsustainable practices,

                largest
                exporters of deforestation, it is clear that the global demand for its product is one of the main causes
                for deforestation. As such, reiterating the role global consumers contribute to the destruction of the
                homes of vulnerable orangutans.</h3>

            <h2>So how can you help? Should we stop buying products with palm oil, or stop buying products with vegetable oil that isn't clearly labelled?</h2><h3>This is not a call to boycott all palm oil. This is a call to shop sustainably to save our orangutans.</h3>
            <p id="chloroText">
                Although the deforestation caused by palm oil has resulted in detrimental habitat losses, it is
                important we do not
                disregard the benefits of palm oil production or call for boycotts of the product. Instead it would be
                more beneficial
                to cultivate and encourage sustainable practices as this could actually improve the environment.
                <br><br> <strong>Of all the vegetable
                    oils available, palm oil is considerably the most efficient oil both in terms of yield to land use
                    ratio. </strong><br><br>
                For example, as shown below, soybeans have the largest land use of all the vegetable oils, but the yield
                is less than a fifth of palm oil's.
                <br><br>
                If we
                discourage the use of palm oil and consumers have to switch to other forms of vegetable oils, we risk
                increasing the
                rate of deforestation and consequently speeding up the demise of the orangutans. Palm oil is an
                efficient oil, but what is hurting our planet is the unsustainable ways some farmers are going about
                growing the crop, and how we, as consumers, are unknowingly buying their byproducts.
