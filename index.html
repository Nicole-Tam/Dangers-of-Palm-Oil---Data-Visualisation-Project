                <h2>Why are they important?</h2>
                <p>
                    Often described as “gardeners of the forest”, orangutans play a crucial role in maintaining the
                    environments within forests. They are inadvertently responsible for aiding seed dispersal within the
                    forests due to their fruit and plant-based diets. In fact, many seeds would not germinate
                    successfully without the digestion of orangutans. Therefore, the loss of orangutans
                    would further propel the environmental degradation and biodiversity loss within the rainforest of
                    Indonesia as species of plants will perish.

                <h2>Current situation:</h2>
                <p>
                    Native to the tropical rainforests of Indonesia, orangutans have been classified as critically endangered
                    with habitat loss being the leading cause. Though there are conservation and protected areas, illegal
                    plantations have forced more than 50% of the orangutan population into unprotected forest where they
                    become vulnerable to poachers. Aside from dealing with habitat loss, low reproductive rates amongst
                    orangutans make their populations highly vulnerable. As females only give birth to one infant at a time
                    every seven to nine years, each female will only be able to bear four to five babies over a lifetime.
                    Therefore, making it harder for the species to recover from population declines.

            Introducing Palm Oil:
            To understand the main driver of habitat loss, we have to look at the palm oil industry. Despite the
            environmental devastation palm oil production in southeast asia has garnered extensive media coverage in the
            past, it has yet to deter the rapid growth of the industry, consequently it has not decreased deforestation
            for the purpose of palm oil production.
