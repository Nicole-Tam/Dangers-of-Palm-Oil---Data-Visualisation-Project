                <h2>Why are they important?</h2>
                <p>
                    Often described as “gardeners of the forest”, orangutans play a crucial role in maintaining the
                    environments within forests. They are inadvertently responsible for aiding seed dispersal within the
                    forests due to their fruit and plant-based diets. In fact, many seeds would not germinate
                    successfully without the digestion of orangutans. Therefore, the loss of orangutans
                    would further propel the environmental degradation and biodiversity loss within the rainforest of
                    Indonesia as species of plants will perish.

            <h2>Current situation:</h2>
            <p>
                Native to the tropical rainforests of Indonesia, orangutans have been classified as critically
                endangered
                with habitat loss being the leading cause. Though there are conservation and protected areas, illegal
                plantations have forced more than 50% of the orangutan population into unprotected forest where they
                become vulnerable to poachers. Aside from dealing with habitat loss, low reproductive rates amongst
                orangutans make their populations highly vulnerable. As females only give birth to one infant at a time
                every seven to nine years, each female will only be able to bear four to five babies over a lifetime.
                Therefore, making it harder for the species to recover from population declines.

            <h2>Introducing Palm Oil:</h2>
            <p>To understand the main driver of habitat loss, we have to look at the palm oil industry. Despite the
                environmental devastation palm oil production in southeast asia has garnered extensive media coverage in
                the
                past, it has yet to deter the rapid growth of the industry, consequently it has not decreased
                deforestation
                for the purpose of palm oil production.</p>

                <h3>So why has the palm oil industry thrived in the past decade?</h3>
                <p>
                    Surprisingly, half of the world's population rely on palm oil as a part of their diet. Thus, as the global
                    population grows, so will the demand for palm oil. Furthermore, many companies globally are not legally
                    required to label palm oil as an ingredient. Instead, it is often labelled under other terms such as
                    ‘vegetable oil’ or ‘vegetable fat’, causing a lot of consumers to be unaware of how frequently they are
                    purchasing products with palm oil.

    <section class="fun-fact">
        <h2>    To put the growth of palm oil production into perspective, in 1970, the world produced 2 million tonnes of palm oil. By
            2020, half a century later, 75.88 million tonnes of palm oil was produced. This represents an increase of 36.9 times the
            amount recorded in 1970.</h2>
